# George's C# Practice Range
### This is where I can track my C# Learning and practice different concepts.

## Linq
The majority of this project focuses on LINQ practice using the puzzles from https://markheath.net/category/linq-challenge.
* `Linq/Program.cs` contains my initial scrawling linq pipelines for each question.
* `Linq/Puzzle1Solver.cs` contains answers to the [Puzzle #1](https://markheath.net/post/lunchtime-linq-challenge).
* `Linq/Puzzle3Solver.cs` contains answers to the harder [Puzzle #3](https://markheath.net/post/linq-challenge-3).
These solvers are unit tested (not many edge cases yet) in `Linq.Tests`.

## Async/await
`AsyncBreakfast` contains practice code and comments from the guide found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/.
`SimpleAsync` contains my attempt at a simple asynchronous example problem involving some (artificially) time-consuming operations on a number.

## Optionals
`Optionals` contains notes from the readme at https://github.com/nlkl/Optional. There is also a practice problem at the end.

## Sandbox
Just a place for scratch code and experimentation before implementing elsewhere.
